# rules:changes

- Paths to files. In GitLab 13.6 and later, [file paths can include variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/16.6/ee/ci/jobs/job_control.html#variables-in-ruleschanges). A file path array can also be in [`rules:changes:paths`](https://docs.gitlab.com/16.6/ee/ci/yaml/index.html#ruleschangespaths).
