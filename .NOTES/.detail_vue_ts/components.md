> When used on native HTML elements, the value of `is` must be prefixed with `vue:` in order to be interpreted as a Vue component. This is required to avoid confusion with native [customized built-in elements (opens new window)](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#custom-elements-customized-builtin-example).
